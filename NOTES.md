## Development Notes

To start development, open two terminal windows in the root directory. In one window, issue this command:

`nodemon app.js`

In the other window, issue this command to start the development server:

`ngrok http 3000`

After these are both running, sign in to the Discord Developer Panel. Update the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to match the ngrok server endpoint.
